# hotel-review-sentiment-analysis
This project analyses hotel reviews from TripAdvisor to determine whether the sentiment is positive or negative. It cleans and prepares the text data, then uses machine learning techniques to categorize the reviews. The best model is saved and can be used to predict sentiment for new reviews in the future.
